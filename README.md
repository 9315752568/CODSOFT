Python Projects by CODSOFT.

This repository contains three Python projects developed as part of the CODSOFT learning program. Each project showcases different aspects of Python programming, from basic arithmetic operations to game development and password generation. The projects included are a Python Calculator, a Python Password Generator, and a Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python.

Python Calculator
.The Python Calculator is a simple yet functional application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It is designed to help users understand the implementation of control structures and basic input/output in Python.

Key Features:
.Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
.Error Handling: Manages division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully.
.User-friendly Interface: Easy to use with clear prompts for input.

Python Password Generator
The Python Password Generator creates secure and random passwords, essential for maintaining good cybersecurity practices. This project demonstrates the use of Python’s randomization and string handling capabilities.

Key Features:
.Random Password Generation: Creates passwords that are random and secure.
.Customizable Length: Allows the user to specify the length of the password.
.Character Diversity: Uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python
The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a classic game implemented in Python. This project is an excellent example of implementing game logic and user interaction in a console application.

Key Features:
.Interactive Gameplay: Play against the computer with instant results.
.Randomized Choices: Ensures the computer’s choices are unpredictable.
.Clear Instructions: Provides easy-to-follow instructions for the user.
